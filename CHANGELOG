2004-04-14 Version 0.02
	* fixed bug where receiver could not contain a colon
	* fixed method invocation bugs, signatures can now contain unnamed
	  arguments
	* numerous documentation fixes
	* the runtime will now try to find a matching method signature
	  for methods that it can't find immediately (to be
	  compatible with CamelBones and the PerlObjCBridge in OSX)
