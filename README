ObjectivePerl version 0.01
==========================

ObjectivePerl is an extension to perl (written entirely
in perl) that allows programmers to use a variant of
Objective-C syntax in perl modules.  It allows:
* very clean class definitions
* true instance variables
* advanced message signatures and argument passing
* instance/class method specification
If you're not interested in any of those things, don't
use ObjectivePerl!  But if you are, go right ahead...
