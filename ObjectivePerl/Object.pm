=head1 NAME

ObjectivePerl::Object - Root class for ObjectivePerl objects

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	use ObjectivePerl;
	@implementation MyClass

	+ new {
		~[$super new];
	}
	@end

In this example, MyClass is a subclass of
ObjectivePerl::Object, even without being
declared as such; all classes declared in this
way descend from ObjectivePerl::Object.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is the root class to all classes declared using the
ObjectivePerl @implementation/@end syntax.  It needs to
be there so that all classes declared in this way have
some super-class and can invoke $super from methods.

=head2 USES

Generally you don't instantiate or subclass this
directly.

=head1 BUGS

None known.
